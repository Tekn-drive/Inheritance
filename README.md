This program is made as my answer for today's quiz of inheritance. This program uses the 'person' class as the parent class which will 'inherit' its properties to the 2 subclasses which are 'mahasiswa' and 'dosen'. This program also utilizes a scanner to get input from the user. In this case, the user can choose the class to be displayed. Like the following:

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229845544-de155608-74b6-4cc3-b4fe-876a340ae347.png)

If the user chooses 1, it will display all of the attributes of the class 'person' and calls the methods which are in the class 'person':

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229845559-ec3fad3c-486e-435a-aee7-f490a6ac8a07.png)

If the user chooses 2, it will display all of the attributes of the class 'person' and calls the methods which are in the class 'mahasiswa':

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229845568-ce92ac35-0ab9-44ae-bef9-358370c804db.png)

If the user chooses 3, it will display all of the attributes of the class 'dosen' and calls the methods which are in the class 'dosen':

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229845582-f7d7f72a-8873-4d8a-88d6-d42b572b62ab.png)

Otherwise, it will display an error message like the following:
