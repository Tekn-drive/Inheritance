This program is made as my answer for today's quiz of inheritance. This program uses the 'person' class as the parent class which will 'inherit' its properties to the 2 subclasses which are 'mahasiswa' and 'dosen'. This program also utilizes a scanner to get input from the user. In this case, the user can choose the class to be displayed. Like the following:

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229955080-fdd6caa6-6852-4a23-a3fe-76b9943a95d8.png)

If the user chooses 1, it will display all of the attributes of the class 'person' and calls the methods which are in the class 'person':

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229955096-f17fb04d-1b1c-4788-9719-a4463a08f6ab.png)

If the user chooses 2, it will display all of the attributes of the class 'person' and calls the methods which are in the class 'mahasiswa':

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229955112-c952832c-929d-438a-8729-772cf7c4bd14.png)

If the user chooses 3, it will display all of the attributes of the class 'dosen' and calls the methods which are in the class 'dosen':

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89509753/229955145-24462f07-08d6-412c-82d6-4707a67a03fc.png)

If the user chooses 4, the program will terminate itself:
